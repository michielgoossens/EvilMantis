Evil Mantis
-----------------------------------------

Evil Mantis is the work name for a game project.
The development team is just a 2 person team: Michiel Goossens - programmer & Vadim Rouquart - graphics.

The game will be a 2d sidescroll platformer, action-adventure.

It's a game where you will be able the choose the good or evil path.
Sometimes it's hard to control the evil. You probably will become evil at some point in the game, but there is always a way to become good again.

The abbilities you can do will also depend on which state you're in.


It's just the beginning, but it will be awesome!!
